## Questioning
> Why another XMPP client?

There are many different XMPP clients out there. Some of them are pretty great, and some of them not-so great (anymore). The goal for this one is to stay as small as possible. Don't make any assumptions on the interface that will be used (i.e. no including stylesheets). The XMPP standard uses add-ons called XEP. There are a ton of them that we have no use for. If you need additional features, here are some other libraries you can check out.
